                <h4>pp. 7-11</h4>
                <p class="drop-cap">Because he had enjoyed almost every advantage since birth, one of the few privileges denied to Benjamin Rask was that of a heroic rise: his was not a story of resilience and perseverance or the tale of an unbreakable will forging a golden destiny for itself out of little more than dross. According to the back of the Rask family Bible, in 1662 his father’s ancestors had migrated from Copenhagen to Glasgow, where they started trading in tobacco from the Colonies. Over the next century, their business prospered and expanded to the extent that part of the family moved to America so they could better oversee their suppliers and control every aspect of production. Three generations later, Benjamin’s father, Solomon, bought out all his relatives and outside investors. Under his sole direction, the company kept flourishing, and it did not take him long to become one of the most prominent tobacco traders on the Eastern Seaboard. It may have been true that his inventory was sourced from the finest providers on the continent, but more than in the quality of his merchandise, the key to Solomon’s success lay in his ability to exploit an obvious fact: there was, of course, an epicurean side to tobacco, but most men smoked so that they could talk to other men. Solomon Rask was, therefore, a purveyor not only of the finest cigars, cigarillos, and pipe blends but also (and mostly) of excellent conversation and political connections. He rose to the pinnacle of his business and secured his place there thanks to his gregariousness and the friendships cultivated in the smoking room, where he was often seen sharing one of his figurados with some of his most distinguished customers, among whom he counted Grover Cleveland, William Zachary Irving, and John Pierpont Morgan.</p>
                <p>At the height of his success, Solomon had a townhouse built on West 17th Street, which was finished just in time for Benjamin’s birth. Yet Solomon was seldom to be seen at the New York family residence. His work took him from one plantation to another, and he was always supervising rolling rooms or visiting business associates in Virginia, North Carolina, and the Caribbean. He even owned a small hacienda in Cuba, where he passed the greater part of each winter. Rumors concerning his life on the island established his reputation as an adventurer with a taste for the exotic, which was an asset in his line of business.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Wilhelmina Rask never set foot on her husband’s Cuban estate. She, too, was absent from New York for long stretches, leaving as soon as Solomon returned and staying at her friends’ summerhouses on the east bank of the Hudson or their cottages in Newport for entire seasons. The only visible thing she shared with Solomon was a passion for cigars, which she smoked compulsively. This being a very uncommon source of pleasure for a lady, she would only indulge in private, in the company of her girl-friends. But this was no impediment, since she was surrounded by them at all times. Willie, as those in her set called her, was part of a tightly knit group of women who seemed to constitute a sort of nomadic tribe. They were not only from New York but also from Washington, Philadelphia, Providence, Boston, and even as far as Chicago. They moved as a pack, visiting one another’s houses and vacation homes according to the seasons—West 17th Street became the coterie’s abode for a few months, starting in late September, when Solomon left for his hacienda. Still, no matter in what part of the country the ladies happened to dwell, the clique invariably kept to itself in an impenetrable circle.</p>
                <p>Limited, for the most part, to his and his nursemaids’ rooms, Benjamin had only a vague notion of the rest of the brownstone where he grew up. When his mother and her friends were there, he was kept away from the rooms where they smoked, played cards, and drank Sauternes well into the night; when they were gone, the main floors became a dim succession of shuttered windows, covered furniture, and chandeliers in ballooning shrouds. All of his nurses and governesses said he was a model child, and all of his tutors confirmed it. Manners, intelligence, and obedience had never been combined as harmoniously as in this sweet-tempered child. The only fault some of his early mentors could find after much searching was Benjamin’s reluctance to associate with other children. When one of his tutors attributed his student’s friendlessness to fear, Solomon waved his concerns away, saying the boy was just becoming a man of his own.</p>
                <p>His lonely upbringing did not prepare him for boarding school. During the first term, he became the object of daily indignities and small cruelties. In time, however, his classmates discovered that his impassiveness made him a dissatisfying victim and left him alone. He kept to himself and excelled, dispassionately, in every subject. At the end of each year, after bestowing on him all available honors and distinctions, his teachers, without fail, would remind him that he was meant to bring much glory to the Academy.</p>
                <p>During his senior year, his father died of heart failure. At the service, back in New York, relatives and acquaintances alike were impressed by Benjamin’s composure, but the truth was that mourning simply had given the natural dispositions of his character a socially recognizable form. In a display of great precocity that baffled his father’s attorneys and bankers, the boy requested to examine the will and all the financial statements related to it. Mr. Rask was a conscientious, tidy man, and his son found no fault with the documents. Having concluded this business and knowing what to expect once he came of age and into possession of his inheritance, he returned to New Hampshire to finish school.</p>
                <p>His mother spent her brief widowhood with her friends in Rhode Island. She went in May, shortly before Benjamin’s graduation, and by the end of the summer had died from emphysema. The family and friends who attended this second, much more subdued memorial barely knew how to speak to the young man orphaned in the course of a mere few months. Fortunately, there were many practical issues to discuss—trusts, executors, and the legal challenges in settling the estate.</p>
                <p>Benjamin’s experience as a college student was an amplified echo of his years as a schoolboy. All the same inadequacies and talents were there, but now he seemed to have acquired a cold sort of fondness for the former and a muted disdain for the latter. Some of the more salient traits of his lineage appeared to have come to an end with him. He could not have been more different from his father, who had owned every room he had walked into and made everyone in it gravitate around him, and he had nothing in common with his mother, who had probably never spent a day of her life alone. These discrepancies with his parents became even more accentuated after his graduation. He moved back from New England to the city and failed where most of his acquaintances thrived—he was an inept athlete, an apathetic clubman, an unenthusiastic drinker, an indifferent gambler, a lukewarm lover. He, who owed his fortune to tobacco, did not even smoke. Those who accused him of being excessively frugal failed to understand that, in truth, he had no appetites to repress.</p>

                <h4>pp. 16-17</h4>
                <p class="drop-cap">He became fascinated by the contortions of money—how it could be made to bend back upon itself to be force-fed its own body. The isolated, self-sufficient nature of speculation spoke to his character and was a source of wonder and an end in itself, regardless of what his earnings represented or afforded him. Luxury was a vulgar burden. The access to new experiences was not something his sequestered spirit craved. Politics and the pursuit of power played no part in his unsocial mind. Games of strategy, like chess or bridge, had never interested him. If asked, Benjamin would probably have found it hard to explain what drew him to the world of finance. It was the complexity of it, yes, but also the fact that he viewed capital as an antiseptically living thing. It moves, eats, grows, breeds, falls ill, and may die. But it is clean. This became clearer to him in time. The larger the operation, the further removed he was from its concrete details. There was no need for him to touch a single banknote or engage with the things and people his transaction affected. All he had to do was think, speak, and, perhaps, write. And the living creature would be set in motion, drawing beautiful patterns on its way into realms of increasing abstraction, sometimes following appetites of its own that Benjamin never could have anticipated—and this gave him some additional pleasure, the creature trying to exercise its free will. He admired and understood it, even when it disappointed him.</p>

                <h4>p. 37</h4>
                <p class="drop-cap">She barely paid attention to the country road and its surroundings, lost in her fulfilled dream of independence, but she was woken up by the stuccoed silence that first met her in town. The dry echo of her shoes on the cobblestones was all she could hear in the empty streets. Every few steps, she gently dragged a foot, just to feel the skin on her neck tingle with delight at the murmur of leather on stone. With each block, the small city became livelier. Trying to prolong the sense of elation she had found in the initial stillness, she walked on, with buoyant aplomb, away from the voices crashing at distant intersections, away from the mercantile clatter coming from the square, away from the liquid hoofbeats clip-clopping around the corner, away from the women yelling from window to window as they unpinned their laundry, and into alleyways with houses shuttered against the heat, where she could hear, again, her solitary steps. She knew, then, that this solemn form of joy, so pure because it had no content, so reliable because it relied on nobody else, was the state for which she would henceforth strive.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>pp. 62-63</h4>
                <p class="drop-cap">Catherine Brevoort had taken permanent residence in the Park Avenue apartment, which Benjamin had bought for her from Sheldon Lloyd. Her social horizons had expanded considerably after Helen’s wedding, and her gatherings had never been more successful. It was plain that most of the newcomers to her soirées attended in the hopes of meeting Mrs. Brevoort’s elusive son-in-law. To Catherine’s credit, these guests kept frequenting her salon even after it had become clear they would never get to see Mr. and Mrs. Rask there. Helen had stopped going to her mother’s get-togethers as soon as she moved in with Benjamin, not only because she had always disliked social occasions, but also because she had found her mother increasingly difficult since the engagement. She knew that Mrs. Brevoort’s newly acquired eccentricities, her heightened frivolity, her calculated impertinence, and her gratuitously flamboyant behavior were not simply manifestations of unbridled joy but acts of a festive sort of aggression directed straight at Helen both as a dare and as a lesson—“This is the life you should be living.” The most eloquent declarations in her mother’s unspoken monologue came in the form of bills and receipts. Mrs. Brevoort’s parties (and her wardrobe and her furniture and her floral arrangements and her hired cars) had become rather extravagant affairs, and all bills were sent to Benjamin’s office. They were never refused or even questioned, but Helen always had them forwarded to her once they had been paid, and she kept them as if they were a collection of one-sided letters from her mother.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>pp. 98-101</h4>
                <p class="drop-cap">Morning brought out a deeper sort of white from the changeless snows capping the peaks on either side of the valley, which, later, in the midday sun, would become blinding splinters. A pastoral bell echoed across the sky, dappled with flocks of small solid clouds, while unseen birds found themselves, yet again, unable to break their bondage to their two or four notes. The air was laced with the scent of water, stone, and the long-dead things that, darkly, were finding their way back to life deep under the dew-soaked dirt. During that unpopulated hour, the buildings ceased to be objects of artifice and industry to reveal the nature fossilized in them and come forth in their mineral presence. The breeze dissolved in stiller air; the treetops, so green they were black against the blue, stopped swaying. And for a moment, there was no struggle and all was at rest, because time seemed to have arrived at its destination.</p>
                <p>Then a nurse with a compress, an orderly with a rake, a doctor with a clipboard, a server with an infusion would set it all in motion again. The itching, the exhaustion, the words, the thoughts behind them, and the noise of her being, so much louder than the world.</p>
                <p>Upon her admittance at the Medico-Mechanic Institute, she visited her father’s room. All the patients staying at the more modest eastern wing, mossy and damp in the perennial shadow of two sharp cliffs, were taken out to the garden while Helen toured the facilities together with her husband and Dr. Frahm. She seemed distracted in her father’s narrow quarters. Her eyes focused a bit beyond each object. It was her fingers that engaged with the space, gently gliding over every surface or tentatively touching a basin or the back of a chair, as if unsure of their consistency and temperature.</p>
                <p>Dr. Frahm signaled Benjamin to leave the room. Indignation rippled across Rask’s face, and he turned his back to the doctor, feigning to have missed his gesture. But he could not ignore Frahm’s hand on his shoulder and his heavily accented request to give them a moment. Benjamin looked at the soft hand on his shoulder; Dr. Frahm lifted it to show him the door; Benjamin lowered his outraged eyes and announced he would wait outside.</p>
                <p>Once they were alone, Frahm invited Helen to lie down on the bed, placed a chair behind the iron headboard, sat down, and asked, in German, what image of her father was conjured up in that room. Was it the man presiding over her childhood or the invalid of her adolescence?</p>
                <p>Helen seemed calmer in German. Although she spoke it with remarkable ease, she also had vast lacunae, as is usually the case with those who have somewhat haphazardly taught themselves a language. Because she often had to pause and find circumlocutions to bypass grammatical voids and lexical gaps, she gave the impression of having slowed down, of having mastered, in some measure, her anxiety. But her German, like all her foreign languages, had come from unusual sources, detached from everyday speech—outmoded books and the affected chatter of dispossessed aristocrats and drawing room diplomats. This gave her words a baroque, theatrical quality that, to some extent, undid the illusion of sanity created by her slower pace, because, despite her innate elegance, she could sound like a bad actress in too much makeup.</p>
                <p>She laughed quietly at the doctor’s question. Only a fool would distinguish past from present in such a way. The future irrupts at all times, wanting to actualize itself in every decision we make; it tries, as hard as it can, to become the past. This is what distinguishes the future from mere fancy. The future happens. The Lord casts no one into hell; the spirits cast themselves down, according to Swedenborg. The spirits cast themselves into hell by their own free choice. And what is choice but a branch of the future grafting itself onto the stem of the present? Past father? Future father? Helen laughed again and moved on to consider the subject of gardening in relation to alchemy. Dr. Frahm, however, knew that Swedenborg had played an important part in her upbringing and gently insisted on this point of access into her childhood—while pursuing Helen’s implication that her father had chosen hell for himself. She talked on, her eyes fixed on a mold stain on the ceiling that resembled a black peony.</p>
                <p>Dr. Frahm started to wean his patient off her medication shortly after her arrival at the Institute. He wanted to observe her symptoms in their purest form, without any interference, he said, and then try the smallest dose of lithium salts. After a gradual withdrawal, when she was about to be completely taken off her sedatives, her mania reached its highest point. Benjamin demanded that his wife be put back on her drugs. The psychiatrist, unmoved by his threatening tone, said he needed a few days more. About a week later, disproving Benjamin’s worst fears, there were signs of mild improvement. Helen was still incoherent and verbose, yes, but failing, time and again, to find a way out of her verbal mazes had made her exhausted, which, in turn, had made her somewhat calmer. Dr. Frahm explained that he was turning her manic condition against itself: her insomnia and frenzied mental activity, together with the natural depletion of certain hormones and her physical regime, would end up having a narcotic effect. She needed to be drained of energy; she needed exercise; she needed air.</p>
                <p>And so it was that Helen, after each sleepless night spent talking to silent snooded nurses, was taken out into the garden with the first light and left alone on a chaise facing the mountains. She continued with her soliloquy while freeing herself from under the tightly tucked blankets. As the sun rose, however, her monologue declined into sporadic mutterings, which, in turn, melted into silence. For an hour or so, she would enjoy the bliss of impersonality—of becoming pure perception, of existing only as that which saw the mountaintop, heard the bell, smelled the air.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>pp. 119-120</h4>
                <p class="drop-cap">Benjamin was not a superstitious man, but on the afternoon of Helen’s third and last injection before their departure, he resumed his place on the bench by the entrance. He was pleased to experience, after so many weeks of inactivity, the contraction of time that took place when he lost himself in work. If asked, he would have been unable to say exactly what his thoughts were during that hour, and yet there was an untranslatable clarity to his mental process. During this focused vagueness that preceded all his great business ideas, the world somehow vanished from his senses. Even his self dissolved into the stream of impersonal thoughts. This is why he did not immediately accept Dr. Aftus’s presence, although his eyes had seen him approach with slow steps. It was only when he sat down next to Benjamin that Aftus acquired the solidity of the real.</p>
                <p>Dr. Aftus put his palms together, making sure each finger exactly mirrored the other, then separated his hands, took a deep breath, and said that in some occasions numbers and statistics have no meaning: each loss is absolute and can never be mitigated by past or future triumphs.</p>
                <p>Benjamin blinked at the doctor’s words.</p>
                <p>After another sigh, Dr. Aftus went on to say that Mrs. Rask’s heart, which had previously responded so well, had given in. He knew his condolences would always be insufficient and was, of course, at Mr. Rask’s disposal, should he decide to conduct an inquest.</p>
                <p>The mountains, the ground, Benjamin’s body were drained of substance and weight. All was hollow.</p>
                <p>He didn’t get up; the planet sank.</p>
                <p>Benjamin walked into the building and down the hall to Helen’s room, surprised to see his feet move and his hand turn the doorknob.</p>
                <p>The nurses froze. He approached the bed. They stepped away.</p>
                <p>As if it were the skin of a delicate fruit, he lifted the sheet. There was nothing restful about Helen’s face. All the pain had remained sealed within. Her body was somehow distorted. Benjamin took a step back, trying to rearrange it in his mind.</p>
                <p>Someone mentioned her clavicle. He turned around. It was the American nurse who had rushed out of the building in tears a few days before. She said Mrs. Rask’s convulsions had been so violent she had broken her collarbone.</p>

                <h3 id="2"><em>My Life</em></h3>

                <h4>p. 135</h4>
                <p class="drop-cap">I am a financier in a city ruled by financiers. My father was a financier in a city ruled by industrialists. His father was a financier in a city ruled by merchants. His father was a financier in a city ruled by a tight-knit society, indolent and priggish, like most provincial aristocracies. These four cities are one and the same, New York.</p>
                <p>Although this is the capital of the future, its inhabitants are nostalgic by nature. Every generation has its own notion of “old New York” and claims to be its rightful heir. The result is, of course, a perpetual reinvention of the past. And this, in consequence, means there are always new old New Yorkers.</p>

                <h3 id="3"><em>A Memoir, Remembered</em></h3>

                <h4>p. 203</h4>
                <p class="drop-cap">For a while, during this same period, my father and I edited and printed a newspaper together, <i>The Carroll Gardens Weekly</i>, a folded sheet that was far from weekly. I interviewed shopkeepers, policemen and neighbors in search of stories—usually involving births, lost pets, people moving into or out of the surrounding buildings and so on. The paper also included highlights from the news (between issues I collected clippings in a scrapbook), a serialized novel (which I wrote under the pen name of Caroline Kincaid), a horoscope (entirely made up) and other miscellaneous, inconsistent sections. No copies of this short-lived paper have survived.</p>
                <p>Flipping through the pages of <i>Seven Stories</i>, the same question always comes up. Did my father preserve my numerous spelling errors out of respect for my writing or because they were invisible to him? Suspecting the latter, I never dared to ask him. Ever since his death I have inexplicably felt that those misspellings bring us closer to each other. That we meet in them.</p>

                <p class="drop-cap">The line started moving. Because we were admitted in groups, rather than slowly shuffling forward, we took several steps every five or ten minutes. There was something exaggeratedly liberating in these short walks. As we reached the entrance, I saw applicants going into the building but never coming out of it. I assumed (and later confirmed) they were dismissed through a back door, probably to prevent us from learning anything from those who were done.</p>
                <p>If we had, for the most part, remained quiet during our wait, the closer we got to the door, the more the silence tightened. We were on our own. And, although there was no sense of hostility in the air, against one another.</p>
                <p>The doorman, wearing a brass emblem of Bevel Investments as if it were a medal, counted to twelve by pointing at our heads with his index finger as we were let into the reception. We were told to wait by a desk. The walls of green marble vanished toward a remote ceiling. What was not made of stone was made of bronze. Nothing shone but everything emitted a pale glow. Sounds had a tactile quality, and we all did our best not to litter the space with any audible objects of our own. A man appeared behind the desk and, like the doorman, pointed at us, one by one, with his pen. We understood he wanted our names. “Ida Prentice,” I said, feeling the blood throbbing in my cheeks as it always did whenever I used this fake name.</p>

                <p class="drop-cap">When the elevator doors reopened, it was to reveal a fictional living room, much more comfortable than any of the real ones I had ever visited. There were four or five other applicants with their cream-colored page, most of whom greeted me with a nod and a half smile (one of them was the girl who had been typing next to me). I can still recall what I felt as I sat down on the edge of the velvet chair, looking around at the sober décor, feeling the delicately chilled air on my calves and listening to the short-lived sounds in the room before they were sponged up by the thick carpet and the plush upholstery—I felt I did not know my city.</p>
                <p>All of us, while we avoided looking at one another and corrected hopeless or invisible imperfections in our clothes, felt something similar, I think. All except for one. She was the only one wearing an appropriate outfit, not only seasonally adequate and color-coordinated but also impeccably tailored. Her face failed to be completely disdainful. After a while I realized it was because she barely had any eyebrows. She got up and moved around the room several times, seemingly for the sole purpose of proving that she could get up and move around the room—that she was not intimidated by it, that she belonged in it. One of these little parades led her to the secretary’s desk. She whispered a few words to her, curving her lips up into something that was not a smile. They giggled under their breath.</p>
                <p>Outside the window two swinging cranes seemed to be about to crash against each other—a trick of perspective. A jackhammer started up, and then another. Screeching circular saws. The rumble of bulldozed debris. All this noise reached the waiting room as little more than a hum—as if the construction site were a playground, and all the tools and trucks toys.</p>
                <p>The door opened. An applicant in a brown suit was let out. Although she was empty-handed, her posture was that of someone clutching something very precious to her chest. She seemed pained. With downcast eyes she walked to the elevator; with downcast eyes she stood waiting for it. The secretary told the well-dressed woman she could step into the office. Rummaging through her purse, the woman pretended not to have heard her. The secretary said, again, she was expected inside. This time the woman gave the secretary an irritated look. She closed her purse and walked into the office. The elevator finally came, and the girl in the brown suit rushed in, pressing herself against a sidewall, where she became invisible.</p>
                <p>Unlike the girl who had been interviewed before her, the well-dressed woman could be heard from where we were, even if discrete words were indiscernible. She talked fast and with animation, interrupting herself, now and again, with bursts of laughter. There were only a few brief pauses during which, presumably, the other person spoke. The secretary started folding papers and stuffing them into envelopes. The rest of us pretended not to notice anything, fully committed to our awkwardness.</p>
                <p>All of a sudden the woman’s gabble stopped. A pause. She spoke again but seemed to be interrupted. A pause. Now she spoke in a lower voice, in both volume and register. A final pause, and the door opened so abruptly that the air upset the pile of envelopes on the secretary’s desk. The woman walked out.</p>
                <p>“Well, I hope you find one of <em>these</em> more suitable,” she said, pointing at us with a disdainful chin. “My uncle will just love to hear about this.”</p>
                <p>She called the elevator, and now it was her time to stand there, waiting, indignant and wounded. It arrived a good while after the next applicant had been called in.</p>
                <p>About half an hour later my turn came.</p>
                <p>I had only seen such grand and austere examples of art deco in films—the stereotypical offices of captains of industry, financiers and magnates of the press, all of whom were usually depicted as heartless despots. Parallel lines chased one another in angular trajectories from the chromed furniture down onto the patterned stone floor, up the wood-paneled walls, onto the window frames and out into the city, continuing on the façades of the surrounding buildings and beyond, following the streets crisscrossing all the way into the horizon.</p>
                <p>A fastidious, bespectacled balding man who looked like a witch—thin-faced, yellow-eyed, a mole on his upcurved chin—pointed to a chair as he sat down on his side of the desk. Next to a massive brass lighter there was a sign with his name. Shakespear. “No final <em>e</em>,” as I would later hear him repeat day after day. Only now did I notice the strong smell of cigarettes and mint in the refrigerated air.</p>
                <p>“Please have a seat, miss . . .” He flipped through his papers, made a checkmark and wrote a few words. “Prentice. Your typing test was impressive.”</p>
                <p>“Thank you.”</p>
                <p>The jackhammers started again.</p>
                <p>“And your steno . . . Yes, impressive.”</p>
                <p>“Thank you.”</p>
                <p>“May I?” He pointed to my typed “autobiography,” which I handed over to him.</p>
                <p>It took him an inordinately long time to read it. Once done, he filed it together with my other tests, jotted down some notes in a book open on his desk and looked at me.</p>
                <p>“While we understand that these are pretty trying times and most of you girls are applying for pretty much every available job, we also want to make sure that we hire someone who doesn’t just <em>need</em> this job but also <em>wants</em> it. Do you <em>want</em> it?”</p>
                <p>“I do.”</p>
                <p>“Why?”</p>
                <p>I never expected to answer the way I did. It was not part of a plan. It was nothing I had prepared. The words simply came out.</p>
                <p>“Why work at a place that makes one thing when I could work at a company that makes all things? Because that’s what money is: <em>all</em> things. Or at least it can become all things. It’s the universal commodity by which we measure all other commodities. And if money is the god among commodities, this,” with my upturned palm I drew an arc that encompassed the office and suggested the building beyond it, “is its high temple.”</p>
                <p>A long pause.</p>
                <p>“I would like you to come back Monday afternoon for a final interview. Announce yourself downstairs at five o’clock sharp. They’ll tell you where to go.”</p>

                <p class="drop-cap">This is the only picture of my mother, taken before she got married. She must be around the same age I was during my interviews for Bevel Investments. A little younger, perhaps. She is wearing a high-collared dress with a row of small buttons down the middle, confident in its plainness, navy blue in my imagination. Her hair is gathered loosely at the top. A bold softness defines her face. This resolute kindness is also in her gray eyes. I have always been sorry that her face has not lived on in mine.</p>
                <p>This single photo has colonized the few memories I have of her. Over time I realized that in almost all the scenes I was able to recall, she appeared in the same dress and with the same hair. It was impossible to stop this simplification of my mother’s image, which now has become pretty much all I have. Strolling through Carroll Park, giving me a bath, walking down Sackett Street, putting me to bed, she is always in the hypothetically navy-blue button-up dress and with gathered hair. I find it devastatingly sad that a woman could disappear to this extent, leaving no trace other than a daughter who barely remembers her.</p>
                <p>For years, between books, I worked on a novel about her. It remains both unfinished and the greatest mistake of my writing life. Because I labored unsuccessfully on that book for so long, my mother acquired, forever, the texture and weight of a half-formed character in my mind. I have even come to distrust my love for her.</p>

                <h4>p. 246</h4>
                <p class="drop-cap">As I read on, however, the prose itself rather than the content became the center of my attention. It was unlike the books they had made me read at school and had nothing to do with the mysteries I used to check out of the library. Later, when I finally went to college, I would be able to trace Vanner’s literary influences and consider his novel from a formal point of view (even if he was never assigned reading for any of the courses I took, since his work was out of print and already quite unavailable). Yet back then I had never experienced anything like that language. And it spoke to me. It was my first time reading something that existed in a vague space between the intellectual and the emotional. Since that moment I have identified that ambiguous territory as the exclusive domain of literature. I also understood at some point that this ambiguity could only work in conjunction with extreme discipline—the calm precision of Vanner’s sentences, his unfussy vocabulary, his reluctance to deploy the rhetorical devices we identify with “artistic prose” while still retaining a distinctive style. Lucidity, he seems to suggest, is the best hiding place for deeper meaning—much like a transparent thing stacked in between others. My literary taste has changed since then, and <i>Bonds</i> has been displaced by other books. But Vanner gave me my first glimpse of that elusive region between reason and feeling and made me want to chart it in my own writing.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 0;"><strong>AM</strong><br>Nurse’s thick accent somehow makes me feel my English is improper. “Can I touch you?” Once she does, she’s assertive. Her hands have the authority her voice lacks. How can someone so meek be so strong? Facing down, forehead on forearms, I wonder if Nurse undergoes a transformation when I don’t see her. At least, her face must look different from the exertion. Once done, she covers me with a sheet that first balloons with a breeze of camphor and then settles with a waft of, I suppose, Alpine herbs. Gooseflesh. “So,” she always whispers before rustling out, leaving me on the table, where I try, and sometimes succeed, to become a thing.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 0;"><strong>PM</strong><br>Church bells. D F♯ E A. Followed by retrograde response: A E F♯ D. The most conventional chime. (Same as Big Ben?) Archaic in its pentatonic simplicity, it condenses most of our musical past: tonal hierarchies, symmetry, tension, release. But here the E bell is louder + more sustained than the others. And a tad flat, in the most exquisite way. If the call/response motif contains our history, that strange lingering 9th is the sound of our musical future. Grazing against the D, it makes the air oscillate. I feel it with the hairs on my forearms.</p>
                <p>Never seen the church.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 0;"><strong>EVE</strong><br>Now able to read. Went through box of new books.</p>
                <p>Started “Voyage in the Dark.” Welsh (?) author seems to have grown up in the West Indies. Reads like a memoire of sorts.</p>
                <p>“A plant made of rubber with shiny, bright red leaves, five-pointed. I couldn’t take my eyes off it. It looked proud of itself, as if it knew that it was going on for ever and ever.”</p>
                <p>“The orchestra played Puccini and the sort of music that you always know what’s going to come next, that you can listen to ahead, as it were.”</p>
                <p>So nicely put. This defines the classical form. Music that one almost doesn’t need to listen to, because its development is all implied by the form. Just as Rhys says in her passage, “you always know what’s going to come next.” This music creates an unavoidable future for itself. It has no free will. There’s only fulfilment. It’s fatal music. Just like the chime I hear every day. D F♯ E A plants + grows the seed of A E F♯ D in the mind before the ear can hear it.</p>

                <p class="drop-cap" style="text-indent: 0;">The squirrel’s dexterous fingers, the petals’ scented colours, the stone beak encrusted in the bird’s face and the lovely implausibility of its flight. All of life’s peculiarities result from a long series of mutations. I wonder what the cells mutating within my body would turn me into, if they didn’t kill me first.</p>

He ended up talking about La Fiesolana. Said he wished we’d spent more time together there. So much of the place he would’ve liked to show me. Family hist., etc. If only we’d gone up more often, he said.</p>
                <p>Kitsch. Can’t think of Engl. trans. for this word. A copy that’s so proud of how close it comes to the original that it believes there’s more worth in this closeness than in originality itself. “It looks just like . . . !” Imposture of feeling over actual emotion; sentimentality over sentiment. Kitsch can also be in the eye: “The sunset looks like a painting!” Because artifice is now the ultimate standard, the original (sunset) has to be turned into a fake (painting), so that the latter may provide the measure of the former’s beauty. Kitsch is always a form of inverted Platonism, prizing imitation over archetype. And in every case, it’s related to an inflation of aesthetic value, as seen in the worst kind of kitsch: “classy” kitsch. Solemn, ornamental, grand. Ostentatiously, arrogantly announcing its divorce from authenticity.</p>
                <p>This, I told A, is why I went to La Fiesolana only a handful of times. That “Tuscan” incongruity is a cathedral to kitsch.</p>
                <p>I’m ashamed of the rush of vitality that coursed through me as I spoke.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 0;">After writing the above, I went over to A’s rooms to apologize. He said he didn’t know what I was talking about + was very gentle. We sat in silence for a while. After gathering some courage, he asked if I’d mind it if he gave me a bracelet. Given what had happened a moment ago, it seemed insensitive to make my usual stand on the matter of jewellery. I smiled. He brightened up + produced a box from his pocket. “Good! Because I already got it!” It’s a slender band of white gold. It’ll be rather lovely once it fades.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 0;"><strong>AM</strong><br>Rereading the above “confession” made me think about diaries. Some journals are kept with the unspoken hope that they will be discovered long after the diarist’s death, the fossil of an extinct species of one. Others thrive on the belief that the only time each evanescent word will be read is as it’s being written. And others yet address the writer’s future self: one’s testament to be opened at one’s resurrection. They declare, respectively, “I was,” “I am,” “I’ll be.”</p>
                <p>Over the years, my diary has drifted from one of these categories to the next and then back. It still does, even if my future is shallow.</p>
