                <p class="drop-cap">
                    A mother gives birth to a firstborn, and blunders through the baby’s infanthood.
                    Then she gives birth to another baby. The second time things are somewhat
                    familiar, less daunting, and yet just as many things can go wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Losing a child for the second time, I knew some things to be important:
                    sleep, hydration, small and frequent snacks, exercise every day. Get out of bed at
                    the regular time and never ruminate while lying in bed. Make the effort to brew
                    good coffee in the morning. Read—one act of Shakespeare is good enough, so is
                    a page of Euclid’s geometry, a chapter of Henry James’s biography, or one poem
                    from Wallace Stevens’s collection. Write—there is no reason to stop working
                    and there is also no reason to strive for regular working hours. Anything that
                    prevents agitation or rumination is good for the mind. And, most important of
                    all, for me: radical acceptance. The death of a child realigns time and space. If an
                    abyss is where I shall be for the rest of my life, the abyss is my habitat. One
                    should not waste energy fighting one’s habitat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have only this abyss, which is my life. And an inevitable part of existing in
                    this abyss is exhaustion, which the second time I learned to accept without
                    protest. My friend Edmund told me that after his Swiss lover died, he felt like
                    one of those women hauling heavy laundry out of a river, all day long, never
                    ending. It seems a beloved’s death makes one a Sisyphus, too. After James died,
                    flowers arrived in front of our door. The flowers deserved attention, but I had to
                    turn myself inside out to find the energy needed for that attention: to cut open the
                    packaging, to trim a bouquet of peonies, to place them in a vase. (Here’s a small
                    thing I’ve learned: if one is to send flowers as a gesture of condolence, better to
                    ensure the flowers arrive already arranged in a vase.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    In that exhaustion, still there is some living to do. What was beyond my
                    capacity I would not aspire to accomplish, so I asked my agents and Brigid to
                    help me cancel travel and public events for the next few months. What was
                    within my capacity I would not shy away from, as work is as essential as
                    breathing and sleeping. I was at the beginning of a nearly yearlong process of
                    judging a prize, and I decided to remain on the judging panel, a decision my
                    intuition told me was the right one and one that the experience itself has
                    confirmed: the reading has offered a structure for my days, and the monthly
                    meetings with the other judges have taken place in a realm that is independent of
                    my personal life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And there was a novel-in-progress that I had been working on for several
                    months. “On the way here I wondered if you would have to take some time off
                    from it,” Brigid said the day after James died, when I told her that I intended to
                    keep working on the novel. “And knowing you, of course you would not.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did not stop writing or take time off from teaching when Vincent died.
                    Writing, teaching, gardening, grocery shopping, cooking, doing laundry—all
                    these activities are time-bound, and they do not compete with my children, who
                    are timeless now. There is no rush, as I will have every single day, for the rest of
                    my life, to think about Vincent and James, outside time, outside the many
                    activities of everyday life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And this, among other reasons, is why I am against the word “grief,” which
                    in contemporary culture seems to indicate a process that has an end point: the
                    sooner you get there, the sooner you prove yourself to be a good sport at living,
                    and the less awkward people around you will feel. Sometimes people ask me
                    where I am in the grieving process, and I wonder whether they understand
                    anything at all about losing someone. How lonely the dead would feel, if the
                    living were to stand up from death’s shadow, clap their hands, dust their pants,
                    and say to themselves and to the world, I am done with my grieving; from this
                    point on it’s life as usual, business as usual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don’t want an end point to my sorrow. The death of a child is not a heat
                    wave or a snowstorm, nor an obstacle race to rush through and win, nor an acute
                    or chronic illness to recover from. What is grief but a word, a shortcut, a
                    simplification of something much larger than that word?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thinking about my children is like air, like time. Thinking about them will
                    only end when I reach the end of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only passage in which grief appears in its truest meaning is from <i>King
                    John</i>, when Constance speaks eloquently of a grief that is called madness by
                    others in the play.
                </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 0em; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; font-size:95%;">
                    Grief fills the room up of my absent child,<br>
                    Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,<br>
                    Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,<br>
                    Remembers me of all his gracious parts,<br>
                    Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;<br>
                    Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?<br>
                    Fare you well. Had you such a loss as I,<br>
                    I could give better comfort than you do.<br>
                    I will not keep this form upon my head<br>
                    When there is such disorder in my wit.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Have I reason to be fond of grief? Yes, as much as a mother has reason to
                    love her children. Alas, few people use the word “grief” these days as
                    compellingly as Constance. For that reason, I prefer that in the abyss that is my
                    habitat, grief is not given a place by design. If it decides to grow there, it will
                    grow like a volunteer rose campion or a sweet violet or a columbine.

                <h3 id="xii">XII. Things in Nature Merely Grow</h3>
                <h4>pp. 78-88</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="drop-cap">
                    Late last year, I planted twelve hundred bulbs, an addition to the seven hundred
                    and the five hundred from the previous two autumns. The tender green had just
                    been popping out of the stale, winter-long snow when James died, and by late
                    March the bulbs were blooming with abandon. Things in nature merely grow—the
                    line has become a reoccurring thought after James’s death—things in nature
                    merely grow until it’s time for them to die.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began to garden when we moved into the house where Vincent had said he
                    would help me improve the garden. Gardening takes time and energy, and things
                    go wrong more often than they go right. Wild animals and pests are abundant in
                    the New Jersey countryside: squirrels, groundhogs, rabbits, moles, voles,
                    Japanese beetles, and deer. The weather is not always friendly: a late spring
                    snowstorm killed off a season of hydrangea one year, and excessive heat baked a
                    flush of roses another year. And yet why raise a fist and protest against weather
                    and wild creatures: they are part of nature, too, like the robins that each spring
                    build a nest in one of the rosebushes, or the wrens making a home in the small
                    birdhouses I hang in the garden specifically for them, or the hummingbirds and
                    the swallowtails busy in the flowers, a mesmerizing, joyful sight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Years ago, when we moved into our first house in California, William Trevor
                    wrote to encourage me to start a garden. When he and his wife, Jane, moved to
                    the Devon countryside, he told me, there had not been a garden there, and
                    decades later, the garden, growing too big for the aged couple, “takes up what
                    time there is.” He talked about reducing the size of the garden and returning part
                    of it to the sheep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But that house up in the Oakland hills was in the woods, so there was not
                    enough sunlight, and my children were young then, and I didn’t seem to have the
                    time. Now that I have a garden, I’ve come to understand Trevor’s point:
                    gardening is good training for a novelist. One learns to be patient, one learns to
                    make concessions, one learns to redefine one’s visions and ambitions, and one
                    learns to stop being a perfectionist. A garden is good training for life, too. Would
                    it have changed Vincent a little, had he had the opportunity to work on the
                    garden with me for a season, several seasons? Better stop asking these questions
                    that tread in the realm of alternatives—whatever the answer is doesn’t make a
                    difference in this life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And one must garden as realistically as one lives after the deaths of one’s
                    children. One must, especially, refrain from giving the flowers and plants
                    metaphorical or symbolic meaning beyond nature’s mere way of being. After
                    James died, someone sent me a picture of spring flowers and touted “earth’s
                    regenerative power.” That kind of language, like the encouragement from people
                    who cheerfully predicted that I would soon reach “the end of the tunnel,” makes
                    me conscious of how people fall into the trap of using clichés to express care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clichés are not merely flabby words used to express unimaginative thoughts;
                    rather, clichés corrode the mind. Flabby language begetting flabby thinking
                    seems a more alarming prospect than the opposite, flabby thinking finding
                    refuge in flabby language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My garden is not a metaphor for hope or regeneration, the flowers are never
                    tasked to be the heralds for brightness and optimism. Things in nature merely
                    grow. There is no suicidal or angry rose, there is no depressed or rebellious lily.
                    Plants have but one goal: to live. In order to live they grow when they can, and
                    go into dormancy if needed. They live until they die—and either they die as
                    destined by nature or are cut down by other elements in nature. A garden is a
                    placeholder. Flowers are placeholders.
                </p>

                    For twenty years, ever since Brigid started to read and edit my work, the
                    word “placeholder” has become an essential concept of my philosophy. Often
                    she underlines a passage and tells me that a sentence is a placeholder for a real
                    sentence, or that a thought is still at a place-holding stage, waiting for a clearer
                    thought to emerge in sharper words.

                    Much of what one does in life is to hold a place for something and to uphold
                    a space for someone. Cooking—for a family of four, then for a family of three,
                    and now for my husband and myself—is making time as concrete as possible,
                    seven days a week. When James was in third grade, a school project required a
                    cereal box, and his friend Jason, concerned that James had never eaten cereal in
                    his life, told his mother that they must provide James with a cereal box so he did
                    not fail his project. Do you want cereal for breakfast, I asked James, telling him
                    that I didn’t mean to deprive him of cereal; that, he replied, would be a sad
                    breakfast. James so rarely used adjectives to describe feelings that I noticed that
                    word “sad” in his reply: if I was limited as a mother, I would nonetheless make
                    sure his breakfast would never be called sad.
                </p>

                    Years ago, after a mental crisis, I stayed in an emergency facility in
                    California for a weekend. At mealtimes, patients lined up to receive trays of
                    mushy, nondescript food, and the man or the woman who handed over the tray
                    would say, “Here, made with love, just for you.” That sentence, along with the
                    police detectives’ line—there is no good way to say this—is among the saddest
                    words ever said to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So all of Vincent’s favorite dishes, which I stopped making after his death;
                    all of James’s favorites dishes, which I stopped making after his death; all those
                    pancakes shaped beyond the letter Z—still one must prevail, looking for new
                    recipes, trying different colors and textures on a plate, making every detail count
                    in a meal as one makes every word count in writing. I would not, however, say
                    that these meals are “made with love.” “Love” is one of those words that, though
                    meaningful to the utmost degree, is meaningless in much of its daily use. I would
                    say these meals are “made with care.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    And parenting—is that not the ultimate effort to hold a place for children, so
                    that, to the best of one’s ability, they can be given all they need to grow? And yet
                    there is futility, too, in this effort: the children are bound to outgrow the space
                    the parents provide; the world is just outside. A mother can cook every meal
                    with great care, but a mother’s care, like a point in geometry, is essential to the
                    order of things, insubstantial in the scale of things.

                    I keep a stack of notebooks on my desk. One notebook is never enough, as
                    different moods and different readings demand their own notebooks; the
                    scribblings are but “words, words, words,” as Hamlet says, and which I
                    sometimes say to myself when I am in the middle of a project, questioning the
                    point of a book. I feel comforted when Elizabeth says this happens to her, too,
                    with every book she writes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While working on this book—“the book for James”—I had a moment of
                    diffidence, feeling that the complaint of “words, words, words” came to me from
                    James. We did not hold a memorial service for James, as we had done for
                    Vincent—it would have been the last thing James wanted, to be at the center of
                    anything, to be remembered publicly, to be put in a position that violated his
                    essence—James, true to Brigid’s observation, is the antithesis of many things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “A book can be more than just a gesture toward the subject of the book,”
                    Elizabeth said to me, very helpfully, when I expressed my doubt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A book is a placeholder, no more, no less. This book for James—what does it
                    hold? All the words that have come to me: many of them fall short; some are
                    kept because they are needed to hold a place for James.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These days, I am conscious of the placeholders in my life, all of them
                    reminders of what I feel—that combination of keen attention and profound
                    indifference, that mixture of intense emotion and an equally intense apathy.
                    Writing a sentence again and again until it feels right is a placeholder.
                    Comparing the hues and scents of two roses on the same branch—one just open,
                    one past its prime—is a placeholder. Spending a few extra minutes to make a
                    vinaigrette with fresh figs and the basil I’ve grown is a placeholder. Reading
                    Anne Carson’s rendition of Hekabe’s extremity—“What shall I cry? What howl
                    shall I howl?”—and thinking about the shadow of those words in Lear’s “Howl,
                    howl, howl, howl!”; listening to the Flower Duet, one of Vincent’s favorites (he
                    was the one to introduce the opera <i>Lakmé</i> to me), or listening to some Gilbert
                    and Sullivan songs, which James’s piano and singing teacher had taught him
                    when he was in grade school, as a way to bring him out of his silence; looking at
                    the old traveling pictures, thinking about but not touching Vincent’s clothes in
                    his closet, thinking about but not being able to unpack James’s suitcase brought
                    back from his dorm—every action is a placeholder, so is every action not taken.
                    What I did for my children once made placeholders of their lives; what I
                    couldn’t do—keep them alive—is the most important placeholder of my life: my
                    children, in their absence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vincent lived feelingly. James lived thinkingly. When Vincent died, I was
                    able to conjure him up in a book by feeling, but I knew, right after James died,
                    that I would not be able to do that for him. James would not like a book written
                    from feelings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The day after James’s death, I told Brigid that to live up to his standards, I
                    must try to live thinkingly; to live according to logic, to facts, and to live in
                    radical acceptance. When she asked me to elaborate, I could not find the words
                    to expand my statement. But I may have a better answer for her question now: to
                    live only with meaningful placeholders and to acknowledge that they are
                    nevertheless only placeholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because placeholders are neither solutions nor salvations. None of them will
                    play the magic trick of delivering me into another realm, where life regenerates
                    itself through hope and love and wishful thinking. Neither my garden nor my
                    writing will solve what is insoluble in my life. Though there are not that many
                    things in my life that are worthy of that adjective, “insoluble.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only insoluble matter, before this past February, was Vincent: he would
                    never be back to be among us, to entertain us with his wit and fantasy, to
                    pressure us to go further in our thinking with his endless questioning. In a piece I
                    published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, about gardening and Vincent, there are two
                    paragraphs that read differently today:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 0em; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; font-size:95%;">
                    One early summer morning, I looked out the window and saw two deer
                    and a rabbit in my front garden, eating up some hydrangea bushes I had
                    planted a few weeks earlier. It occurred to me that, had I been able to go
                    back to my childhood self and tell her that one day I would live in a place
                    where rabbits and deer eat side by side peacefully, the child would be
                    incredulous: certainly no real people could live in a fairy tale like that?
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; font-size:95%;">
                    “I am sure that if you had been told when you were a child about all
                    the things that you were going to have to do, you would have thought
                    you had better die at once, you would not have believed you could ever
                    have the strength to do them.” In West’s trilogy, Richard Quin says this to
                    his mother before he leaves to be killed in France. Had I been able to go
                    back to my childhood self and tell her that one day I would live as a
                    mother who has lost a son, the child would be equally incredulous: surely
                    such things happen only in fiction, to characters who are much more
                    interesting and tragic?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    James, who graduated from high school in his blue cap and gown, was still
                    kept safe in the bubble that was called last year when the piece was published.
                    Had I been able to go back and tell myself that in six months I would live as a
                    mother who has lost two sons, the novelist in me and the mother in me would
                    have been equally incredulous. That wouldn’t do, in fiction or in life. I would
                    have raised my voice and protested: that only happens in Greek tragedies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chorus, singing about Herakles’s children, who would soon be killed by
                    Herakles in a frenzy of madness, admonishes (in Anne Carson’s translation):
                    “Bad luck is not gone from these children, but neither is beauty.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before we went to James’s high school graduation, I asked him if he would
                    give me permission to make a bouquet of flowers from my garden and present it
                    to him at the ceremony. He declined, as I knew he would. At the ceremony many
                    of his schoolmates took selfies and then posed for their parents—there was a
                    careless beauty in their unconsciousness of becoming images in memory, just as
                    there was a serious beauty in James’s decision not to step in front of a camera. A
                    few months later, I would be going to accompany James to his first day at
                    college. Most children walked through an arch made of orange and black
                    balloons, with the university’s logo behind them, posing with cloudless smiles
                    on their faces. James looked at the crowd and chose a side door to enter the
                    building.
                </p>
                <p>
                    James did not give me permission to take a picture of him as a freshman,
                    though he did allow me to take one picture of him at high school graduation,
                    standing in front of an arch made of blue and white balloons. It was one of the
                    few pictures I had of him after Vincent’s death—before that they seemed to be
                    always smiling and laughing and making faces for my phone camera. Perhaps it
                    is not an exaggeration to say that James, before exiting the world, had begun to
                    turn away, evading the cameras, evading attention, evading, even, the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I dropped Vincent off near that high school on a September morning,
                    we did not know that he was going farther than the school gate that day. When
                    we sent James to college last September, we did not know that he too was going
                    farther than the college campus. They both journeyed on more resolutely than I
                    would have wanted them to, and they both crossed that great, awful distance
                    after I said my last “I love you” to them.
