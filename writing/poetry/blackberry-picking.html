            <div>
                Late August, given heavy rain and sun<br>
                For a full week, the blackberries would ripen.<br>
                At first, just one, a glossy purple clot<br>
                Among others, red, green, hard as a knot.<br>
                You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet<br>
                Like thickened wine: summer's blood was in it<br>
                Leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for<br>
                Picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger<br>
                Sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-pots<br>
                Where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots.<br>
                Round hayfields, cornfields and potato-drills<br>
                We trekked and picked until the cans were full,<br>
                Until the tinkling bottom had been covered<br>
                With green ones, and on top big dark blobs burned<br>
                Like a plate of eyes. Our hands were peppered<br>
                With thorn pricks, our palms sticky as Bluebeard's.<br>
                <br>
                We hoarded the fresh berries in the byre.<br>
                But when the bath was filled we found a fur,<br>
                A rat-grey fungus, glutting on our cache.<br>
                The juice was stinking too. Once off the bush<br>
                The fruit fermented, the sweet flesh would turn sour.<br>
                I always felt like crying. It wasn't fair<br>
                That all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot.<br>
                Each year I hoped they'd keep, knew they would not.<br>
