                            <p>As a high schooler, I spent many late nights staying up to study. 
                                One night, the overhead light in the living room seemed to shine particularly brightly, 
                                its bright rays grasping at the muted windows locking out the creeping stygian darkness. 
                                It struck me that if I found it profitable to labor away at my worldly studies, how much more worthwhile 
                                would it be to deploy my time and energy to learn divine truths! As one raised in Awana, the discipline of 
                                Scripture memorization immediately came to mind. By the Spirit's conviction, I began anew a journey that had 
                                been planted in my mind and heart as a child (Prov. 22:6).

                                What does Scripture teach us about itself? What does Scripture command about knowing Scripture?

                                <em>Why memorize?</em> We naturally learn and memorize what we love and immerse ourselves in. 
                                And immersing our minds in memorized Scripture further nurtures our love for the Word. 
                                Just as the finest antidote to a prayerless life is to pray more, as prayer begets 
                                a heart for prayer, so too does memorization of Scripture beget a heart for the Word of God.

                                Serious Scripture memorization, by character, involves study, meditation, and discipline. 
                                The consequences of effective Scripture memorization are manifold, of which the most important is 
                                knowledge and fear of God, leading to Wisdom (both in the Solomonic and salvific sense) and eternal life.

                                Too many secondary benefits exist to describe in detail here, but they include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Spiritual nourishment (Deut. 8:3; Job 23:12; Jer. 15:16)</li>
                                    <li>Defense against spiritual warfare and temptation (Ps. 119:9-11; Eph. 6:10-20)</li>
                                    <li>Deeper intellectual enrichment, understanding, and reflection (Prov. 2:1-15)</li>
                                    <li>Love for and competence in evangelistic witness (Matt. 10:19-20; Acts 13:42-52; 1 Pet. 3:15)</li>

                                As an evangelist at heart, I would be remiss to not emphasize this last point. 
                                Our recitation of the Word, particularly verbatim, provides a solid basis for relational evangelism, 
                                which can include apologetic defense of the faith. I have found many an occasion when a well-timed 
                                reference to God's Word, in its purest, most direct form, has led to a fruitful conversation about 
                                the Gospel or a meaningful prayer through which the Spirit transforms a heart of stone into a heart of flesh (Ezek. 36:26-27).

                                        And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, “It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it aside and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles. For so the Lord has commanded us, saying,<br><br>

                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘I have made you a light for the Gentiles,<br>

                                        And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed. And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region. But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district. But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium. And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

                                Among the spiritual disciplines, Scripture memorization can in particular become an inward-facing 
                                habit that forsakes the fundamentally outward-facing nature of the Christian life. 
                                Intentional evangelism using the vehicle of Scripture memorization is one way to evade this trap, 
                                but abundant opportunities exist for your personal spiritual gifts and inclinations to be applied 
                                through the lens of Scripture memorization.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="3">3. Aim</h3>
                            <p>
                                I suggest a pragmatic approach to Scripture memorization. God's Word deserves more than our very best, 
                                so you may be tempted to approach it with a perfectionist mindset. However, often spiritual and intellectual 
                                growth is optimized and God's glory maximized by a more practical methodology that emphasizes breadth 
                                of memorization over perfect recall. For the common layperson with limited time and capacity, 
                                I have found it best to accept at the onset that perfect recall and retention are unattainable, 
                                though a minimum level of rigor and persistence are indispensable for making this effort worthwhile. 
                                Balance between the two extremes of perfectionism and carelessness is key.
                            </p>

                                <em>As spiritual discipline.</em> As a spiritual discipline, Scripture study and memorization requires 
                                patient consistency, personal and corporate accountability, and a longing after God for maximal effect. 
                                This is perhaps a more intellectual pursuit than other disciplines, but the potential for spiritual 
                                formation is great should you prioritize the godly habits and posture of heart characteristic of any 
                                spiritual discipline but that hold utmost importance in Scripture memorization.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="4">4. Strategy</h3>
                            <p>
                                <em>Planning.</em> Gather and adapt for yourself the resources you will need for your memorization journey. 
                                This includes but is not limited to an initial repertoire of Scripture to learn, memorization strategies 
                                (which we will discuss below), and a memorization schedule. Set up group accountability as able, though 
                                I caution telling others who will not keep you accountable; in such cases, it is better to labor quietly (1 Thess. 4:11-12). 
                                In this planning phase, briefly simulate your memorization process to identify personal preferences, 
                                potential challenges, and methods to streamline your approach.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Rigorous memorization.</em> Start by memorizing well with as close to perfect recall as possible. 
                                Be strict with yourself and tolerate no mistakes. In this early stage, it is better to memorize 
                                one verse deeply and perfectly (i.e., verbatim) than multiple shallowly and imprecisely. Rigor at the 
                                start will facilitate good habits and provide a solid foundation for more accurate and rapid memorizing 
                                of new Scripture in the future.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>First-pass methodology.</em> The most effective way to learn a passage for the first time will be operator dependent. 
                                Different people learn best through varying combinations of hearing, reading, saying, and/or writing. 
                                I favor using some type of assistance tool such as the <a href="/bible-memory.html#Verse_Flash">Verse Flash</a> tool 
                                that only displays the first letter of each word. Once this assisted rendition of the passage has been mastered, 
                                I move on to independent active recall, perhaps facilitated using a tool such as the <a href="/bible-memory.html#Memory_Drill">Memory Drill</a> 
                                tool. At this point, I will typically recite the passage in my mind throughout the day until I can rattle it off 
                                by memory faster than an unsuspecting listener can comprehend what I'm saying.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Decay as a worthy opportunity cost.</em> Everything has an opportunity cost, including memorizing deeply 
                                and perfectly. After you have memorized a decent block of Scripture well&mdash;arbitrarily, 
                                say, 30-50 verses/passages&mdash;it may be wise to emphasize breadth over retention. 
                                There are a few reasons for my recommendation: 1) As you expand your repertoire, it will take more 
                                time and energy to retain what you have already learned; 2a) Once you have a base of memorized Scripture, 
                                it will be easier to learn new Scripture with similar language and theology; 2b) Similarly, it will be 
                                easier to re-memorize forgotten Scripture, and reviewing memorized material following increasingly longer 
                                periods of time is, in fact, the basis for spaced repetition (further discussed below); 3) This is not the 
                                case for everyone, but taking a break from reviewing "old" Scripture to memorize "new" Scripture can be 
                                an exciting and motivating endeavor that will prevent burnout. Ultimately, sustainability is key, whether 
                                in fostering interest in the discipline or maintaining momentum in learning.

                                <em>Reviewing and maintenance.</em> It may be wise to allow for some memory decay over time, but it is still 
                                crucial to maintain a baseline level of active recall testing and spaced repetition, which are key concepts of 
                                the popular and powerful flashcard app <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>. Briefly, 
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> is an evidenced-based 
                                learning technique that exploits the spacing effect to more efficiently encode learned information 
                                into long-term memory. For good reason has Anki become a rite of passage for every medical student 
                                in an age of unmanageable volumes of ever-evolving medical knowledge. In my experience, unfortunately, Anki is 
                                not particularly useful or practical when first learning a passage due to the importance of learning 
                                every constituent word without error. In the reviewing and maintenance stage, when you can realistically 
                                recite the entire passage from memory before verifying with the text on the flashcard, Anki can be set up 
                                in any number of ways to guide the timing and selection of passages to review; in other words, it is being 
                                used primarily for its spaced repetition algorithm. I do think delegating the timing and tracking of reviews 
                                to Anki is more optimal than other methods, such as manually (and probably haphazardly) reviewing handwritten 
                                flashcards as many of the older generations are accustomed to doing, but fretting over these differences probably 
                                yields diminishing returns and you should ultimately do what's most helpful and sustainable for yourself.

                                <em>Who likes group projects?</em> Effective accountability is helpful; memorizing alongside a partner 
                                or small group is rewarding. However, group work introduces potential complications. Halfhearted partners 
                                can compromise the entire operation. And even with the best intentions, it can be logistically difficult 
                                to coordinate regular check-ins that augment your personal memorization work. For this reason, I recommend 
                                keeping the group to a relatively small party&mdash;ideally two to three and no more than five or so&mdash;of 
                                like-minded brothers and sisters who are serious and passionate about the Word. Consider utilizing 
                                the group not just for memorization drilling and accountability, but also for Scripture study, prayer, 
                                sharing, and fellowship (which includes recreation and leisure). Knowledge of the Word should infuse all that 
                                we do&mdash;it should be a lens through which we see the world&mdash;so a group centered around Scripture 
                                memorization should reflect that life-giving spirit (Acts 2:42-47).

                                <em>Know the context.</em> The cousins of Scripture memorization are Scripture study and meditation. 
                                Without study, how are we to understand what we recite? And without meditation, how are we to mold 
                                our hearts around the glorious truths that we quote? Understanding context includes knowing how the 
                                verse or passage fits into its chapter, book, and testament: Who are the writer(s) and audience? 
                                What is the ongoing narrative or logical argument being presented? What does this teach us about 
                                human nature and Divine character? How does this point to Christ? Use your hermeneutic skills to 
                                delve into the literary, logical, and theological essence of the passage.

                                <em>A word about Hebrew, Greek, and modern translations.</em> As you progress in your memorization journey, 
                                consider studying the original Hebrew or Greek texts. For the layperson without academic training in these 
                                languages, an online (or physical) Strong's Concordance, such as the one available at 
                                <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/">Blue Letter Bible</a>, can provide powerful insight into the 
                                intent of the original God-breathed language and allow you to thematically connect (or contrast) 
                                passages that use similar (or different) wording. Further, you can deepen your understanding by studying 
                                how different translations render the text&mdash;and a fuller understanding leads to longer-lasting 
                                internalization of the text. An auxiliary benefit I find from comparing translations is to discover man's 
                                attempt at capturing God's timeless wisdom in the beautiful, imperfect language by which I interact with and seek 
                                to understand Him. Briefly, the translation gamut runs between formal equivalence (i.e., literality, or "word-for-word" 
                                translation) and dynamic equivalence (i.e., interpretation, or "thought-for-thought" translation). 
                                The former extreme produces versions such as the New American Standard Bible (NASB), while the latter 
                                includes versions such as the New Living Translation (NLT). My preferred version to memorize is the 
                                English Standard Version (ESV), which is close to the formal equivalence terminus but allows room 
                                for interpretive beauty of thought and language. Many Americans prefer the New International Version (NIV), 
                                which is perhaps aligned exactly opposite to the ESV on the dynamic equivalence end. For purposes of memorization, 
                                I do not recommend translations of more extreme dynamic equivalence than the NIV, and I personally avoid 
                                the NIV for most situations other than those rare instances in which certain familiar phrases have entered the common 
                                English cultural lexicon. In my opinion, the translators of these "thought-for-thought" (or even "paraphrased") versions 
                                take far too much liberty in their interpretations of the original text, and the language tends to be built in an 
                                almost juvenile manner that feels wholly inadequate in its ability to convey the depth and richness of Holy Scripture. 
                                In contrast, many find the beauty of the English language most lucidly reflected in the King James Version (KJV); 
                                for this reason and other sentimental ones I have committed to memory many passages in the modernized rendition, 
                                the New King James Version (NKJV). Ultimately, these translations are all imperfect reflections of the original 
                                Hebrew and Greek, which themselves are incomplete descriptors of the exquisite, flawless Divine Wisdom that we seek 
                                to know through Scripture. Nevertheless, I urge you to spend thoughtful and prayerful time in examining which version(s) 
                                you will choose to primarily (and secondarily) memorize.

                                Memorized Scripture is ineffective without application to one's own life and encouraging its application in the 
                                lives of others, such as through teaching. Moreover, the memorization process is advanced by utilizing multiple 
                                modalities of Scripture immersion: hearing, seeing, speaking, writing, studying, doing, teaching, preaching. 
                                In short, this spiritual discipline is not a static one that can be performed in isolation&mdash;it must be pursued 
                                actively and integrated into daily life, both personally and corporately.

                                Formulate and execute your plan based on the strategy discussed above. Establish a daily routine of Scripture 
                                memorization that integrates into your daily rhythm of spiritual disciplines. Set aside ample time for prayer 
                                and reflection every week or so for thoughtful examination of your progress. If something isn't working, then 
                                adjust your approach accordingly. I suggest keeping a record of your progress, including the passages you have 
                                learned, the methods you have found effective, and any relevant reflections. Date your entries so you can 
                                periodically look back across longer spans of time. I like keeping an updated Word document and Excel spreadsheet, 
                                but use whatever works best for you, whether that's a physical journal, written notecards, or automated tracking 
                                software (e.g., Anki).

                                it is extremely difficult and subjective to compile any beginner's list of verses to memorize. I attempted to balance 
                                cultural fame, theological centrality, and practical relevance in my selections. I could repeat this exercise 10 times 
                                and produce 10 different lists that all make me uncomfortable with their deficits, so use this merely as a starting point.

                                <em>Expand your repertoire.</em> In your personal Scripture study and devotional reading, always stay on the lookout 
                                for meaningful passages to commit to memory&mdash;finding passages this way comes with the advantages of already 
                                knowing the context and selecting verses that the Spirit has illuminated for you. When expanding your repertoire, 
                                consider your theological strengths and weaknesses; to the former, you may decide to add passages that address 
                                more advanced concepts in which you are interested, while to the latter, you may focus on filling in gaps in your 
                                knowledge. Think about what passages would bear particular relevance in day-to-day application, both in your own 
                                life as well as the communities you traverse and serve. Engage with other brothers and sisters involved in serious 
                                Scripture memorization to share ideas and resources.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Memorize for the occasion.</em> Goals and deadlines can be powerful motivators. Certainly you can set a goal to 
                                memorize X verses by Y time. More concretely, you may choose to memorize a certain set of Scripture in preparation 
                                for a specific evangelistic opportunity or event, to defend a particular doctrine in a certain context or in 
                                conversation with a certain person, or to combat a singular sin that has been disrupting your growth in the current season. 
                                There is always an occasion for which memorizing Scripture will act as fruitful preparation, so be creative!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Teach and preach.</em> Teachers are foremost learners. And Scripture memorization is ultimately an act of preaching, 
                                whether to oneself in the rhythm of self-recitation or to others in the proclamation of the gospel-filled Word. 
                                Think about which passages can be juxtaposed and connected, and what passages are missing from your repertoire to 
                                fashion an intelligible, cohesive, and persuasive presentation of the gospel or other specific theological topic. 
                                The actual setting of the teaching or preaching can be variable&mdash;Bible study, sermon series, bedtime story for 
                                the kids&mdash;but the same joy of Scripture memorization, recitation, and application is always present.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Sustainability and momentum.</em> Sustainable practices beat intense bursts of memorization in the long run, 
                                but sometimes the latter is necessary to provide momentum and further motivation for the former. Elijah defeats 
                                the prophets of Baal in a fiery flurry of intense action (1 Kings 18), but he subsequently recuperates with a nap 
                                and a snack (1 Kings 19:4-8). And it is in this setting that he hears the still small voice of the 
                                <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> (1 Kings 19:9-18). May we be so blessed as to hear the voice of the 
                                <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> in our pursuit of Him.
                            </p>
