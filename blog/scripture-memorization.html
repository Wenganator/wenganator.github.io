                            <p>As a high schooler, I spent many late nights staying up to study. 
                                One night, the overhead light in the living room seemed to shine particularly brightly, 
                                its bright rays grasping at the muted windows locking out the creeping stygian darkness. 
                                It struck me that if I found it profitable to labor away at my worldy studies, how much more worthwhile 
                                would it be to deploy my time and energy to learn divine truths! As one raised in Awana, the discipline of 
                                Scripture memorization immediately came to mind. By the Spirit's conviction, I began anew a journey that had 
                                been planted in my mind and heart as a child (Prov. 22:6).

                                What does Scripture command about knowing Scripture?
