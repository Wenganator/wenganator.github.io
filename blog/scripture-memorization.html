                            <p>As a high schooler, I spent many late nights staying up to study. 
                                One night, the overhead light in the living room seemed to shine particularly brightly, 
                                its bright rays grasping at the muted windows locking out the creeping stygian darkness. 
                                It struck me that if I found it profitable to labor away at my worldy studies, how much more worthwhile 
                                would it be to deploy my time and energy to learn divine truths! As one raised in Awana, the discipline of 
                                Scripture memorization immediately came to mind. By the Spirit's conviction, I began anew a journey that had 
                                been planted in my mind and heart as a child (Prov. 22:6).

                                What does Scripture teach us about itself? What does Scripture command about knowing Scripture?

                                <em>Why memorize?</em> We naturally learn and memorize what we love and immerse ourselves in. 
                                And immersing our minds in memorized Scripture further nurtures our love for the Word. 
                                Just as the finest antidote to a prayerless life is to pray more, as prayer begets 
                                a heart for prayer, so too does memorization of Scripture beget a heart for the Word of God.

                                Serious Scripture memorization, by character, involves study, meditation, and discipline. 
                                The consequences of effective Scripture memorization are manifold, of which the most important is 
                                knowledge and fear of God, leading to Wisdom (both in the Solomonic and salvific sense) and eternal life.

                                Too many secondary benefits exist to describe in detail here, but they include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Spiritual nourishment (Deut. 8:3; Job 23:12; Jer. 15:16)</li>
                                    <li>Defense against spiritual warfare and temptation (Ps. 119:9-11; Eph. 6:10-20)</li>
                                    <li>Deeper intellectual enrichment, understanding, and reflection (Prov. 2:1-15)</li>
                                    <li>Love for and competence in evangelistic witness (Matt. 10:19-20; Acts 13:42-52; 1 Pet. 3:15)</li>
                                </ul>
                                As an evangelist at heart, I would be remiss to not emphasize this last point. 
                                Our recitation of the Word, particularly verbatim, provides a solid basis for relational evangelism, 
                                which can include apologetic defense of the faith. I have found many an occasion when a well-timed 
                                reference to God's Word, in its purest, most direct form, has led to a fruitful conversation about 
                                the Gospel or a meaningful prayer through which the Spirit moves a heart of stone into a heart of flesh.

                                    <p>
                                        And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, “It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it aside and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles. For so the Lord has commanded us, saying,<br><br>

                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘I have made you a light for the Gentiles,<br>

                                        And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed. And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region. But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district. But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium. And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

                            Among the spiritual disciplines, Scripture memorization can in particular become an inward-facing 
                            habit that forsakes the fundamentally outward-facing nature of the Christian life. 
                            Intentional evangelism using the vehicle of Scripture memorization is one way to evade this trap, 
                            but abundant opportunities exist for your personal spiritual gifts and inclinations to be applied 
                            through the lens of Scripture memorization.

                                I suggest a pragmatic approach to Scripture memorization. God's Word deserves more than our very best, 
                                so you may be tempted to approach it with a perfectionist mindset. However, I would argue that your 
                                growth would be optimized and God's glory maximized by a more practical methodology that emphasizes breadth 
                                of memorization over perfect recall. ***

                                <em>As spiritual discipline.</em> As a spiritual discipline, it requires consistency and (both personal and corporate) accountability for maximal effect.

                            <p>
                                Start by memorizing well with as close to perfect recall as possible. Then can allow for some decay over time but continue active recall testing and spaced repetition (the key concepts of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>). ***

                            <p>
                                Know context. Read, study, and meditate. Understand the theological implications of the passage. 
                                What is the original Hebrew or Greek? How do other translations render the original God-breathed words?
                                Use multiple modalities: hear, see, speak, write, and teach the Word. (Ezra 7:10)

                                Overall balance of formal equivalence (i.e., literal) vs dynamic equivalence (i.e., interpreted): ESV
                                Beauty of language: KJV/NKJV. 
                                Formal equivalence: NASB. 
                                Dynamic equivalence: NIV. For purposes of memorization, I do not recommend translations of more extreme dynamic equivalence than the NIV (and I prefer to avoid the NIV for most situations other than those in which certain familiar phrases have entered the common English lexicon)***

                                Expand your repertoire.
                                Interconnect themes. Think about which passages can be juxtaposed and connected.
                                Memorize for a specific purpose. For example, to prepare for a specific evangelistic opportunity, to defend a specific doctrine, to combat a specific sin, or to give a call to worship.
                                Sustainable practices beat intense bursts of memorization, but sometimes the latter is necessary to provide momentum and further motivation for the former.
                                Teach and preach. Bible study, sermon series.
