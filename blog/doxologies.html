                                <strong>What is a doxology?</strong> A doxology is a short hymn of praise to God. 
                                The word comes from the Greek word δοξολογία (<i>doxologia</i>), 
                                which comprises δόξα (<i>doxa</i>) meaning "glory," and λογία (<i>logia</i>), meaning "saying." 
                                The Bible is rife with doxology formulations, whether in the form of a prayer, a song, or a benediction. 
                                We'll explore some of these here. I have also included exhortations adjacent to the doxologies where applicable.

You shall love the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.</p>
                                            <p>“And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.</p>

You shall fear the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God and serve Him, and shall take oaths in His name. You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who are all around you (for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is a jealous God among you), lest the anger of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God be aroused against you and destroy you from the face of the earth.</p>
