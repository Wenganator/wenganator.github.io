                                Diaz builds an argument about custody—of wealth, of story, of credit. The book’s design is not a trick; 
                                it is a method. Each document narrows who gets to speak and who gets believed. In that sense Trust is 
                                less about money than about authorship as a financial instrument.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The novel’s first movement gives the theory plainly: “He viewed capital as an antiseptically living thing” (p. 16). 
                                The metaphor is exacting. Capital acts, reproduces, and purifies itself by abstraction. The later sections 
                                show that narrative behaves the same way—compounding, hedging, off-loading risk onto other people’s lives. 
                                Diaz’s formal choice is the critique: a ledger of versions where control of the account is the entire plot.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The book is therefore about fabrication as policy. “So if money is fiction, finance capital is the fiction of a fiction” (p. 216). 
                                Philanthropy, publicity, ghostwritten self-defense—these are not decorations on power; they are its operating system. 
                                The text keeps asking who underwrites a “truth,” who audits it, and which losses get socialized as “history.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Formally, the pages move from display to testimony: from the public myth of a titan to marginalia and private record. 
                                The moral center appears not as revelation but as voice reclaimed. “Nothing more private than pain. It can only involve one” (p. 370). 
                                Diaz doesn’t sentimentalize this privacy; he treats it as an evidentiary limit. Some harms cannot be absorbed into the 
                                master story without being erased by it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Reading <i>Trust</i> becomes an exercise in calibration. Early fluency invites assent; subsequent documents demand scrutiny; 
                                by the end, belief feels like a resource that should be budgeted. The pleasure here is not the twist but the audit—watching 
                                how explanation is financed, how reputation books its gains, how authorship covers its short positions with someone else’s voice.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I finished the novel with admiration for its control. Diaz’s sentences are lucid and precise, sometimes allowing themselves 
                                a literary flourish, but always disciplined by clarity. More striking, though, is the rigor of his design. The novel shows 
                                how writing—diaries, memoirs, novels, ledgers—creates competing claims to truth, and in doing so suggests something larger: 
                                that in life as much as in fiction, truth rarely arrives whole. It is pieced together, mediated by perspective, subject to power. 
                                This is what lingers after the last page—that form can both expose and conceal, and that our grasp of truth is always provisional, 
                                always narrated.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “Lucidity, he seems to suggest, is the best hiding place for deeper meaning—much like a transparent thing stacked in between others” (p. 246).
