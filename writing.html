            <h1> Lord, Sovereign and Gracious, Eternal and Merciful </h1>
            <p> Lord, Sovereign and Gracious, Eternal and Merciful,<br>
                Thou art the Ruler of all realms, high and lifted up,<br>
                yet through thy Son thou stoopest down to the dust,<br>
                to gather the wayward, the weary, the lost.</p>
                
                <p>Thou hast written thy story on every dawn,<br>
                marked thy sovereignty in the dance of stars,<br>
                and shown thy mercy in the gift of grace.</p>
                
                <p>Before time began, thou didst ordain my days;<br>
                before I drew breath, thou didst set thy love upon me.<br>
                In thy wisdom, thou hast woven my steps<br>
                into the tapestry of thy will,<br>
                and even my wandering serves thy purposes.</p>
                
                <p>Teach me, O Lord, that thy ways are not my ways,<br>
                that thy plans are deeper than the oceans,<br>
                that thy mercy is wider than the heavens,<br>
                that thy justice and love flow as one mighty river.</p>
                
                <p>Let me know that to be humbled is to be lifted,<br>
                that to be broken is to be healed,<br>
                that to surrender is to find victory in thee.<br>
                Make me to see that thou art strong in my weakness,<br>
                that thy grace is sufficient when I am empty,<br>
                that thy Son is my righteousness,<br>
                when all I bring is rags of shame.</p>
                
                <p>Through Jesus Christ, thou hast bound my wounds,<br>
                turned my mourning into joy,<br>
                and called me thine own, though I am unworthy.<br>
                For he was bruised that I might be healed,<br>
                stricken that I might be redeemed,<br>
                abandoned that I might be embraced,<br>
                pierced that I might be cleansed.</p>
                
                <p>Lord, let thy sovereignty quiet my fears,<br>
                thy grace still my striving,<br>
                thy love anchor my heart.<br>
                Teach me to rest in thy mighty hands,<br>
                to trust in thy eternal goodness,<br>
                and to lean upon the cross where love and justice meet.</p>
                
                <p>In the storms, be my calm;<br>
                in the trials, my refuge;<br>
                in the valley, my vision of heavenâ€™s light.<br>
                For though I am but dust and ashes,<br>
                thou hast crowned me with mercy<br>
                and clothed me in the righteousness of thy Son.</p>
                
                <p>Make me thy servant, willing and obedient,<br>
                that my life might testify of thy sovereign grace,<br>
                and my heart rejoice in the fullness of Christ.</p>
                
                <p>To thee, O Lord, be all glory, majesty,<br>
                dominion, and authority,<br>
                before all time, now, and forever.</p>
                
                <p>Amen.</p>
